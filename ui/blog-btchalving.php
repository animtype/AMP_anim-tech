<h1>BITCOIN halving countdown, 12th of May</h1>
        <p rel="author"><small><em>By Dr.Peter, Februar 2020</em></small></p>
		
	<h2>Bitcoin was designed as a deflationary currency.</h2>

	<p><strong>Hey, what does "BTC halving" imply?</strong>
	<br>
	The Bitcoin halving decreases the number of new bitcoins generated per block. As of now, the block reward is 12.5 coins per block and will fall to 6.25 coins per block. This means the supply of new bitcoins is lower. </p>

	<p><strong>So, this could bring the price up?</strong>
	<br>
	In most markets, lower BTC supply with steady demand usually leads to higher prices. But, since we have been in the middle of the pandemic crisis, the path in front of us might be more volatile as you think.
